# NTSC Demodulator Project

A project to explore and extend NTSC demodulation techniques using functional programming approaches.

## Overview

This repository contains work related to demodulating NTSC video signals using purely functional programming techniques. The project builds upon the original Rust implementation by [KaneLabs](https://github.com/KaneLabs/ntsc-demodulator), which has been included as a submodule for reference.

## Features

- Functional programming approach to NTSC signal processing
- Type-safe implementations
- Modular architecture with composable components

## Getting Started

*Instructions for setup and usage will be added as the project develops.*
